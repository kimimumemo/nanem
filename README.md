Moreover, the fourth industrial revolution has had a positive impact on various sectors including the agricultural sector. However, the lack of knowledge about agriculture in today's generation and limited innovation for the development of the agricultural sector has made the goal for food security and modernizing the agriculture sector harder to reach.
